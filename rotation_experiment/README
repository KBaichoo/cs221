This directory contains the test files, a script for running the model and a
script for rotating imgs by 180.

The idea is that a 180 rotation of an image is equivalent (we tried other
rotations by ran into issues), so we're trying this one at least.
If differs on rotation of img, then our model doesn't understand rotation.
